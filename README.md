FRNS consists of two key components: the Fine-grained Feature Refinement (FFR) module, designed to enhance the precision of local image features through the extraction of foreground information and the removal of background noise; and the Text Noise Suppression (TNS) module, which effectively mitigates the impact of irrelevant or misleading textual information by identifying and masking unmatched words with high probability.\
